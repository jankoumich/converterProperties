### converterProperties

This project goal is to create a program, which converts any given data input (currently *CSV*) and output property 
files (currently *java properties*). Furthermore, user can escape special characters with desire escape sequence 
(currently *HTML escape sequence* `1` or nothing `0`).



## Motivation

Copying translations from an Excel spreadsheets, one by one, to a java properties file is a very time consuming and 
prone for a human error process. The main goal of this project is to reduce the amount of time spend on manual process
 so developers have more time for actual development. 



## How to use

You and either run it through terminal and follow the command prompt instructions or run from your IDE. To run from 
your command prompt, navigate to directory where you save project. Then cd into _src->main->java_ and run `javac Main.java` after that run `java Main`.  
Currently you can only upload the *CSV* file and 
decide if you want to keep the original values (`0`) or escape special character using the *HTML escape sequence* 
(`1`). Enjoy :simple_smile:
